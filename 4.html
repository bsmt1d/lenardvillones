<h1 align =center>Julias Caesar (100B.C.-44B.C.)</h1>
</font>
<p>Gaius Julius Caesar was a revolutionary personality of the historic times whose life has been romanticized by the famous William Shakespeare himself through his works. He is arguably the most popular Roman politician and a reputed writer of famous Latin prose. His legacy can be estimated from the fact that his name is synonymous with leadership, and the month of July is named after him. </p>
