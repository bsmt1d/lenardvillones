<p>Ashoka or Asoka was another Gupta dynasty Emperor of India who was given the title of ‘The Great.’ He was the grandson of the Gupta dynasty’s founder, Chandragupta Maurya. Asoka the Great was the last emperor of the Maurya empire, ruling from 269 BC. He, too, made significant conquests, and his kingdom included nearly the whole Indian subcontinent. Today, he is recognized as a prominent Buddhist advocate who preached Buddhist principles and lessons from Buddha’s life to the people.</p>
