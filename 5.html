<h1 align =center>Franklin D Roosevelt (1882 – 1945)</h1>
</font>
<p>Franklin D. Roosevelt, often known as FDR, was an American political leader who guided and assisted his country during some of its darkest years, such as the Great Depression. FDR’s leadership teachings are still applicable for business executives today, even more than 80 years later, especially those leading a company through difficult circumstances. Roosevelt had polio at the age of 29, leaving him crippled in both legs. Nonetheless, he was elected President in 1933, and he is the only President who has been elected four times in a row until he died in 1945. He has shown enormous personal courage every day of his life.</p>
